**Student's Name:** Richard Gregory

**Mentor:** Timothy Johnson

**Project:** Zowe Python SDK Enhancements for Zowe v2 

**Project Description:** There is growing interest in the Zowe Python SDK! The goal of the project is to make various enhancements to the Zowe Python SDK z/OSMF files and jobs.

**Problem Definition:** Mainframe users who want to easily interact with z/OSMF using Python do not have a feature-complete SDK.

**Deliverables:** By the end of the internship, the Files APIs in this [milestone](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-client-python-sdk/milestone/35) should be exposed in the SDK.
